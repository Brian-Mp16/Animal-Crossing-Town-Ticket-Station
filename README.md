---------------- Town Tickets Description ---------------

Town Tickets is a program you use while playing Animal Crossing GameCube. Inspired by New Horizons, the goal is to complete tasks for tickets which can be exchanged for items that you can acquire in game through Animal Crossing's built in Nook Code system. This is a standalone program, not a mod!



---------------- How to use Town Tickets ----------------

1) LOAD PROGRAM:	Ensure the program loads and no graphical errors are obvious (see above for requirements and troubleshooting) then read Tom Nook's dialog on the main screen.
2) INPUT INFO:	On the main screen, click "My Town" then "Change Name" and input your player name, town name, and birthday to match what you have in your Animal Crossing game. Now select which tools you have, if you have island or e-reader access, and which of Nook's store you have. You may return here later to update this information as you play Animal Crossing!
3) COMPLETE TASKS:	On the main screen, click "Go to Tasks." Hover your mouse over tasks to see what to do. While you play Animal Crossing, you may work on completing tasks. Left-click the task to increment it and right-click to decrement it (if you misclicked, for example). Once the task is complete, left-click it again to claim your tickets reward! Every day at midnight, a new set of 5 tasks will replace the current ones.
4) REMOVE TASKS:	If you right-click a task when it's at 0, you may pay tickets to discard that task. The cost will increase by 50 tickets to a max of 500 for each discarded task for the rest of the day. I added a ton of logic to ensure no tasks are impossible to do given the time of day and tools owned, but I still wanted to add this failsafe feature.
5) SHOP FOR ITEMS:	You may spend your tickets in the shop to acquire items. Every single item in the game's catalog as well over 100 miscellaneous and beta items are available! Hover over an item to view its model and other info. Seasonal items such as holiday items, etc. are available for a limited time during the year. Rare items such as Crazy Redd items, etc. must be unlocked to purchase. Availability information can be found by hovering over the item. You may filter item selections using the various filters in the shop.
6) PURCHASE ITEMS:	When you click an item in the shop, you may purchase it, if you have enough tickets and it's available. This will give you a Nook Code which you can find in your Catalog.
7) NOOK CODES:		On the main screen, click "My Catalog" to view items you've purchased. You may filter similarly to the shop. If you click an available item, you are provided a Nook Code that you may use in Animal Crossing to acquire your item in game. Once you have received your item in the game, let Nook Code in the Town Tickets program!
8) FAST CODES:		Most items have a fast code variant which can be toggled on in the top-right corner of "My Catalog." These codes are faster to type to Nook but have a random town and player name associated with them. They have been filtered to ensure they are safe to use. Please report any bugs/issues with fast codes to my Discord above.
9) ACHIEVEMENTS:	In the main screen, click "Achievements" to view what you've accomplished in your town tickets program! This is purely for entertainment, have fun!

And that's it! Please feel free to reach out on my Discord (see above) if you have any questions or comments on my Town Tickets program! I hope this inspires people to enjoy playing Animal Crossing GameCube with a fresh perspective and a new challenge. Now there truly is always something to do in Animal Crossing no matter what time you play!
